# ShaikhaAlN.github.io 30MFF Movie Website Documentation
- In the beginning, I designed this wireframe to fit the theme of the 30MFF video we made. 
The video was representative of how one might experience an art gallery and was set in the NYUAD art center. 
I still wasn’t clear on the color scheme I wanted to use so I used a black and white base for the design. 
I imagined having preview images and text presented in a format similar to how artworks would be framed on a wall in an art gallery. 
I also included links to other pages that would include information relevant to the video in case visitors wanted to learn more. 
I used simple shapes as to not stray too far from what’s possible since this was my first time working with html, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

- However, my design was ambitious with the animation that would lead visitors to the video if they clicked on the arrow on the left hand side of page. 
Even though I didn’t use this element in my final website, I hope to learn how to code it and hopefully incorporate it in future assignments. 
In the final website, I also did not include separate pages, and had everything in one page. 
This decision was made in hopes of creating a more modern design that viewers can get through easily. 
When working with html and very basic CSS, I followed this tutorial on YouTube and created a basic website that looks like this:

<br>
- I experimented with positioning text, font sizes and adding links and images. When I was comfortable with html and some CSS code, 
I started looking for a suitable color scheme for the theme of the website. I wanted something calming and easy to look, because this 
is what is usually associate with the art gallery and how it’s supposed to make the audience feel. I used this website to find color schemes 
and I settled on the one below for its calm neutrals and pop of green that I can use to make the text look distinguished. 
I used a rgb convertor instead of using hex so that I can control the transparency for each element by putting a value between 0 and 1 
after the rgb values in the bracket.

<br>
- For my first run of the website, I noticed that I had a hard time formatting the look, especially since I was still getting confused 
with divs and margins. I didn’t like how the alignments were very off and looked incoherent. I then watched the CSS crash course video 
on YouTube that was linked in the lecture slides, and got a better idea of how to use CSS and its features.

<br>
- I realized that I made a few bad decisions with the first version of the website;
- -	I did not use a container to control the margins of the page and create a cohesive look
-	- I tried to put all the elements of the page in first and edit their positions after. This made it really hard to have a 
sense of control since moving or working on one thing would immediately effect everything else, and it would feel overwhelming 
because I didn’t know where to start.
<br>
- So in this final version, I started over completely and instead of adding all the elements on the page, I went in order. 
I also created a new brief wireframe of the layout I wanted to use. This one took into consideration my abilities and what I 
had learned so far. It also allowed me to picture the page more clearly.

- I started coding the elements from top to bottom one by one. For the top bar with the links, I made the div sticky so that it would stick 
to the top of the screen while the user is scrolling. I then formatted the images, but then decided to only do one at the top. I used a tutorial 
on the web to create the enlarging effect whenever the user would hover over the image. I also added this same effect to the other images, and 
used the hover function on the links to make them a lighter color, and on the subtitles of the different sections and used the translate function 
to have them move. This added a simple interactive element to the whole page that wasn’t too overwhelming, but would be interesting. I made sure 
I used the same colors for the background and the font so that the design was cohesive, and used similar margin settings too. One problem I ran 
into was with JavaScript, although I followed this tutorial on YouTube, the interactivity did not change or reflect on the actual website. I tried 
different methods and possible solutions but nothing worked. Here is the final webpage:
